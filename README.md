# ansible

This project showcases how I use Ansible to streamline and automate the configuration of my diverse set of personal devices â€“ a macOS laptop, an Ubuntu desktop, and a Raspberry Pi. By leveraging Ansible's infrastructure-as-code approach, I maintain consistent setups, reduce manual errors, and effortlessly provision new systems or roll back changes
